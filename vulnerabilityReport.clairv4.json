The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU.\n\nCVE-2019-9511:\n\tSome HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.\n1741860: \nCVE-2019-9511 HTTP/2: large amount of data requests leads to denial of service\n",

Using the EM side-channel, it is possible to extract the position of zero and non-zero wNAF digits while nss-certutil tool performs scalar multiplication during the ECDSA signature generation, leaking partial information about the ECDSA nonce. Given a small number of ECDSA signatures, this information can be used to steal the private key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-12403:\n\tA flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability.\n1868931: CVE-2020-12403 nss: CHACHA20-POLY1305 decryption with undersized tag leads to out-of-bounds read\n\nCVE-2020-12402:\n\t1826231: CVE-2020-12402 nss: Side channel vulnerabilities during RSA key generation\nA flaw was found in NSS, where it is vulnerable to RSA key generation cache timing side-channel attacks. An attacker with sufficient access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process could recover the private key. The highest threat to this flaw is to confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-12401:\n\t1851294: CVE-2020-12401 nss: ECDSA timing attack mitigation bypass\nA flaw was found in nss.

An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application compiled with NSS.\n1774835: CVE-2019-11756 nss: Use-after-free in sftk_FreeSession due to improper refcounting\n\nCVE-2019-11727:\n\t1730988: CVE-2019-11727 nss: PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be used for TLS 1.3\nA vulnerability exists where it possible to force Network Security Services (NSS) to sign CertificateVerify with PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures when those are the only ones advertised by server in CertificateRequest in TLS 1.3. PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures should not be used for TLS 1.3 messages. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 68.\n\nCVE-2019-11719:\n\tWhen importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8format with leading 0x00 bytes, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This could lead to information disclosure. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 60.8, Firefox \u003c 68, and Thunderbird \u003c 60.8.\n1728436: CVE-2019-11719 nss: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key\n",
